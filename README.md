# 🔐 Python-Based Ethical Hacking Tools

This repository contains a collection of simple Python scripts developed for **educational** and **cybersecurity research** purposes. These tools demonstrate common attack vectors such as **Denial of Service (DoS)**, **Keylogging**, and **SQL Injection** to help understand how these attacks work in controlled and ethical environments.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
> These tools are intended solely for educational use in ethical hacking environments such as labs or penetration testing with proper authorization. **Any unauthorized use is strictly prohibited and illegal.**

## 🧰 Tools Included

### 1. 🚨 DoS Attack Script (`dos_attack.py`)
A basic script that sends repeated requests to a target IP and port to simulate a denial-of-service condition.

- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python DOS Attack.py <target_ip> <port>

### 2. 🚨 Keylogger Script (`keylogger.py`)
A simple keylogger that captures keyboard inputs and logs them locally.

- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python Key Logger.py

### 3. 🚨 SQL Injection Script (`sql_injection.py`)
A basic simulation of a SQL injection attack for demonstration against a vulnerable web form.

- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python SQL_Injection.py <target_url>
